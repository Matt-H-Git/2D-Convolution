# 2D-Convolution
Manual convolution of images using different types of kernels

The sample.png image is used to generate the results, and the test.png image is used for testing purposes to see what types of edges are detected by different kernels.

The program takes about 15 minutes to produce a result, after the convolution calculation is finished the program may appear to not show the image but it will appear after about 5 minutes
